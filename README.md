This project is a full-scale logistics and delivery platform designed to operate at the level of modern on-demand delivery apps like Uber Eats, DoorDash, or Glovo. It supports a three-sided marketplace — Restaurants/Vendors, Customers, and Riders — with real-time operations, automated dispatching, and a complete order-to-delivery workflow.
