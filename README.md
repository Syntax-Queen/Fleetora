# 🚀 Fleetora  

**Status:** 🚧 Under Development


Fleetora is a next-generation logistics and food delivery platform built to solve the hardest problems in modern delivery systems.

It is a high-performance, three-sided marketplace designed to match or exceed platforms like Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Glovo. Fleetora enables real-time coordination between customers, vendors (restaurants), and riders, with a strong focus on speed, scalability, and system reliability.

The platform supports real-time communication, including live chat and calls powered by WebSockets, ensuring instant interaction across all parties. The backend uses a performance-driven split architecture: Flask powers the vendor/restaurant services, while Go (Golang) handles customer and rider services for low-latency execution and concurrency efficiency.

Core capabilities include a dispatch algorithm, structured order state management, secure payment workflows, and real-time driver tracking. The system is designed with production-grade logistics architecture, not as a toy project or simple CRUD app.

Fleetora is under active development, with ongoing work focused on performance optimization, fault tolerance, and feature expansion.
